# Digital Signal Processing (Cyfrowe Przetwarzanie Sygnałów) – Assignments

## Assignment 1 – Signal and Noise Generation

This task implements a signal processing tool that allows users to generate, visualize, and analyze various types of signals and noise through an intuitive graphical user interface.

### Implemented Features

- **Generation of 11 signal types:**
  - Uniform noise, Gaussian noise
  - Sinusoidal (regular, half-wave rectified, full-wave rectified)
  - Square wave (classic and symmetric), triangular signal
  - Unit step, unit impulse, impulse noise

- **Support for continuous and discrete signal modes**

- **Interactive GUI** built with **PyQt6**

- **Visualization using matplotlib:**
  - Signal plots (amplitude vs. time)
  - Histograms with adjustable bin count (5–20 bins)

- **Binary file support:**
  - Save and load signal data
  - Customizable signal and sampling parameters (amplitude, duration, sampling frequency, etc.)

- **Basic operations on signals:**
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

- **Display of signal parameters:**
  - Mean, absolute mean, RMS, variance, average power

- **Signal history and reuse:**
  - Combine previously generated signals using arithmetic operations

- **Multi-screen support:**
  - The application window is centered on the second screen if available
